tecnica=Techniques
tecnica1=Sublimation
tecnica2=What we call textile sublimation is a relatively recent technique of personalizing or printing white 100% polyester garments. It is the ideal printing system for technical and sports garments because it does not cover the pore of the fabric and allows perspiration.
tecnica3=Serigraphy
tecnica4=Screen printing on paper and textiles have a very similar operation. They are made from the passage of ink by a mesh stretched on a screen and stamped color by color, in the case of the textile, directly on the garments. Textile screen printing is a very old technique that, although nowadays it is assisted by machines, it is still an artisanal process.
tecnica5=Vinyl
tecnica6=The vinyl is a plastic material in the form of thermo-adhesive sheet that is manufactured with different finishes according to the effect that is intended to be obtained. In textile printing, we distinguish between 2 types of vinyls, basically those of cutting and printing and cutting.
tecnica7=Tr\u00e0nsfer
tecnica8=It is a fast, economical system that provides very attractive results on shirts and light cotton garments. It allows to reproduce photographs, complicated designs or with many colors. Ideal for promotional textiles or occasional events. It is one of the preferred systems of advertising and marketing agencies.
